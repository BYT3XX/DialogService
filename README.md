# Making a custom Dialog UI
Here is a guide I made in a rush that shows what to not delete and what you are able to do without breaking the entire module

## DO NOT DELETE:
- Dialog
- SpeakerName
- RemoteEventHandler
- ChoiceContainer

## WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT IT BREAKING
- Move and scale objects
- Anything else, like UI styling stuff, changing buttons to ImageButtons, and anything that doesn't delete the important items.
