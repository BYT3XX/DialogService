Easy, scriptable dialog with support for choices.

(NOTE: I forgot to convert sizes and position to the scale property while making Beta #1. Will be fixed in Beta #2)

# Symbol Book
- CROSS: Means that the API call can both be used on client and server scripts thanks to some RunService magic.

# Roadmap

(Expected in Beta #2 (v0-beta.2))

## Method: DialogService:UpdateTextInDialog()

Create basic text animations and more without calling ShowDialog().
(Expected in Beta #2 (v0-beta.2))

Easily create more immersive dialogue perspectives and dialogue-animatic hybrids.
(Expected in Beta #2 or #3 (v0-beta.2 or .3))

# Making a custom Dialog UI
Here is a guide I made in a rush that shows what to not delete and what you are able to do without breaking the entire module

## DO NOT DELETE:
- Dialog
- SpeakerName
- RemoteEventHandler
- ChoiceContainer

## WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT IT BREAKING
- Move and scale objects
- Anything else, like UI styling stuff, changing buttons to other UI interaction objects, and anything that doesn't delete the important items.
